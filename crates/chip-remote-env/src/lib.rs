//! Rust Chip's capabilities, executed in an external execution environment.
//!
//! This crate knows one thing about the outside world: it can run a command there, given an argv
//! and an environment, and get back its exit status and captured output ([`CommandRunner`]). There
//! is no stdin. It does not know what provides that (a container, a hosted machine, a remote
//! machine), and it knows nothing about any particular product.
//!
//! Rust Chip keeps every decision about what a capability means. [`RemoteCapabilityBackend`] is a
//! `CapabilityBackend` like any other: Chip validates the request, then the backend asks the
//! environment to run **Rust Chip's own executor** for that capability (the [`worker`], shipped as
//! `chip capability-exec`) against the project in that environment. The environment performs
//! the process; the meaning of `project.write`, the shape of its observation, the validation of its
//! inputs and the interpretation of `pax.test` stay exactly what they are locally, by construction.
//!
//! A [`RemoteEnvironment`] is the environment-contract side: one work's capabilities, observation
//! invariants and opaque identity, all operating inside one external environment.
//!
//! The command's own receipt (whatever the environment records about having run it) is the
//! environment's evidence that it executed something. It is not a Chip receipt and never settles a
//! goal: the observation Chip interprets is the worker's output.
